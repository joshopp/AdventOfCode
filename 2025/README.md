# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for the **Advent of Code 2025** by Eric Wastl.

This folder contains the Python code I wrote while working through the 2025 puzzles during December 2025. The puzzle texts and inputs can be found on the Advent of Code [website](https://adventofcode.com/2025). Solutions are added day by day as completed.

## Structure

- One file per day (e.g. `day01.py`, `day02.py`, …)
- Each day typically contains:
  - Part 1 solution
  - Part 2 solution
  - Optional notes or helpers
- Each file needs an input file (e.g. `input_1.txt`, `input_2.txt`, …). These inputs have to be downloaded from the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
 
## Approach

- Focus on correctness first
- Clean, readable code
- Language features and techniques may vary by day
- No attempt to hide brute force where it’s good enough

## Status

- Some days may be missing or incomplete
- Improvements and refactors may be pushed later

## Reminder

If you're solving AoC 2025 yourself:  
don’t copy blindly — the learning is the whole point
