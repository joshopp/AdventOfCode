# Advent of Code

This folder contains my personal solutions to the [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com).

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels created by [**Eric Wastl**](was.tl). <br>
It can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. <br>
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
 
Each subfolder represents one year and includes my solved parts for that event. <br>
The goal of this repository is learning, experimentation, and improving problem-solving skills — not providing optimal or shortest solutions.

## Structure

- One folder per year (e.g. `2025`)
- Each year has one file per day
- Solutions are added as I complete them

## Notes

- Solutions are written for clarity and correctness, not micro-optimizations
- Some days may be missing or partially solved
- Refactors may happen after the event

## Disclaimer

These are **my own solutions**.  
If you're currently participating in Advent of Code, try solving the problems yourself first.
